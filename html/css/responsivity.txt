Relative Measurements

Responsive design refers to the ability of a website to resize and 
reorganize its content based on:

1.The size of other content on the website.
2.The size of the screen the website is being viewed on.

Relative Measurement units
 em checks the parent element were he nested to resize
 if the parent element font is 16px:
	1em = 16px;

 rem (root em), similar to em, but he checks the root size
 <html> to resize, if font-size of html is 20px:
	2em = 40px;

	This units is used to size text
	
To size non-text elements relative to their parent elements on page
can be used percentages(%)
When height and width are set using percentages, the
 dimensions of child elements are calculated based on the dimensions 
of the parent element.
When percentages are used to set padding and margin, however,
 they are calculated based only on the width of the parent element.

Max & Min attribute
Limit how wide an element can be.
	min-width: 300px;
	max-width: 600px;

When a browser window is narrowed or widened, text can become either 
very compressed or very spread out, making it difficult to read. These two
 properties ensure that content is legible by limiting the minimum and maximum widths.

Media Queries
Uses in css
	@media only [devices] and (max,min property){

		}

Range
Is when delimits a limit
	@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px){
			//width with 320 or <=480
		}

	
DPI (Dots per Inch) dpc (dots per centimeter)
	@media only screen and (min-resolution: 480dpi){
		}

And Operator and Comma Separated
With 'and operator' the browser read the properties like a single specification, 
 comma separated '(),()' browser will read and work when all properties are called
